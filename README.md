# Linear_Regression_beta_and_VaR_Calculation
In this project the data used is from the yfinance.
We show how to get the Beta index from 2 different stocks of the IBOVESPA with the Linear Regression after that we also calculate the VaR (Value at Risk) for a portfolio that could have this 2 stocks.

The Beta index and the VaR are two measures that help to calculate the potential risk of an investment. More details about the calculations are in the notebook.
